		<h2> Kevin Systrom </h2>
		<h4> Founder and Chief Executive Officer </h4>
		<img src="../Images/pic 1.jpg" alt= "Kevin Systrom">
		<p>Mark Zuckerberg is the founder, CEO of Instagram along with  Mike Krieger in the year of 2010.Firstly, he founded the photo-sharing and, later, video-sharing social 
		networking service Instagram  in <a href="https://www.sftravel.com/">San Francisco, California.</a></p><br>
		<p>In April 2012, Instagram, along with 13 employees, was sold to Facebook for US$1 billion
		in cash and stock. According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom US$400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.
		One of the key contributions to the acquisition is that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook is &ldquo;<em>committed to building and growing Instagram independently&rdquo;</em>, 
		allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram. Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook 
		were that &ldquo; <em>we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best,
		if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them 
		as our resource&rdquo;</em>.</p><br>
		
		<p>In an interview with Forbes, he stated that &ldquo;Instagram is a new form of communication that's an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today's
		social media world. Instagram's a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or 'like' photos and share them on
		Twitter or Facebook.&rdquo; Systrom identifies Instagram as a media company, 
		which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as <em><a href="https://www.disney.com/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.activision.com/">
		Activision</a>, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW</em> in late 2014.</p><br>
		
		<p>Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram has rolled out 
		features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment 
		on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, 
		Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013. 
		<em>Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, 
		Rise, Sierra, Sutro,
		Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro.</em></p><br>
		
		<p>Systrom hired former <em>Yahoo Vice-President</em> <strong><a href="https://www.jameseveringham.com/">James Everingham</a></strong>, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as
		high-ranking executives at Instagram. 
		As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram. As of June 2016, Instagram had over 500 million active users.
		In the future, Systrom seeks to develop Instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app.
		He also stated that in a few years, 
		the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products.</p>
