		<h2 id="cntr"> Features and Tools </h2>
			<p>Users can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, and 
			geotag images with the name of a location. Users can set their account as &ldquo;private&rdquo;, thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking
			sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites. In January 2011, Instagram introduced <a href="https://www.hashtags.org/">hashtags </a>to help users discover both photos and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags 
			both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like "photo", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users. In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and
			live filters, instant tiltâ€“shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon. In August 2015, Instagram started allowing users to upload full-size landscape and 
			portrait photos and videos onto the service, dropping the previous requirement of a square frame. In August 2016, Instagram added a zoom feature that allows users to pinch-to-zoom the screen to virtually
			zoom in on photos and videos.In September 2016, Instagram removed Photo Maps, which previously allowed users to see a map of their geotagged photos. An Instagram spokesperson stated that "Photo Map was not 
			widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other priorities". In December 2016, Instagram introduced a feature letting users save photos for later viewing. Bookmarked posts get added 
			to a private page in the app. The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into different collections.</p>

			<p>In February 2017, Instagram announced that users would be able to upload up to ten pictures or videos to one post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel. The feature originally limited photos to the square
			format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead. In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; version of the Explore 
			tab. Later in May, Instagram added an &ldquo;<a href="https://archive.org/">Archive</a>&rdquo; feature, letting users hide posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting 
			photos that don't garner a desired number of "likes" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the "emergent behavior" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content. In August, Instagram announced 
			that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies. In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called &ldquo;focus mode,&rdquo; which gently blurs the
			background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.Instagram shopping allows users to tap on a product they like in Stories and Feed and click a tag that takes them to the company's product list. Users can also build a shopping list inside the platform by tapping on a tag and
			saving it.</p>
		
		<h3 id="cntr"> Explore</h3>
			<p> In June 2012, Instagram introduced &ldquo;Explore&rdquo;, a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search. The 
			tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations. In April 2016,
			Instagram added a &ldquo;Videos You Might Like&rdquo; channel to the tab, followed by an &ldquo;<em>Events</em>&rdquo; channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, 
			sports games, and other live events, followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October. The tab was later expanded again
			in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically-curated page of the "best" Instagram Live videos currently 
			airing. In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.
		
		<h3 id="cntr">Video</h3>
			<p> Initially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013. The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's 
			attempt at competing with then-popular video-sharing application <a href="https://vine.co/">Vine</a>. In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos. In March 2016, Instagram
			increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds. Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.</p>
		
		<h3 id="cntr">Instagram Direct</h3>
			<p> In December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos
			and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending 
			and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people. The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading 
			and making it possible for users to share locations,<a href="https://www.hashtags.org/"> hashtag pages</a>, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages
			with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation. A new update 
			in November 2016 let users make their private messages "disappear" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.
			In April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads.
			In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.
			</p>
		
		<h3 id="cntr">Instagram Stories</h3>
			<p>In August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. 
			Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to<a href="https://www.snapchat.com/"> Snapchat</a>. In November, Instagram added live video functionality to 
			Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending. In January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, 
			where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories. In April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a "clone"
			of Snapchat's functionality. In May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters,
			letting users add specific visual features onto their faces. Later in May, TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public
			Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page. A few days later, Instagram announced "Story Search", in which
			users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term. In June 2017, Instagram revised its 
			live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately. In July, Instagram
			started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags. Stories were made
			available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.</p>

			<p>In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that "Day One: Instagram was a combination of <a href="http://hipstamatic.com/camera/">
			Hipstamatic</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en">Twitter</a> [and] some 
			stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology". Although Systrom acknowledged 
			the criticism as "fair", Recode wrote that "he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among 
			them that they serve different consumer audiences". Apart from that if you want to get separate information please give a just one click
			on<a href="https://www.instagram/harmonise_beauty/"> ME</a> Systrom further stated that "When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that
			it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that." He also told the publication that Snapchat &ldquo;didn't have
			filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.&rdquo;</p>
