			<p>In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move to its new headquarters,
			the former Sun Microsystems campus in <a href="https://www.menlopark.org/">Menlo Park</a>. All users outside of the US and 
			Canada have a contract with Facebook's Irish subsidiary &ldquo;Facebook Ireland Limited&rdquo;. 
			This allows Facebook to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa 
			and South America. Facebook is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it
			to pay just about 2–3&percnt; corporation tax on all international revenue. In 2010, Facebook
			opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad and the first in Asia. </p>
			
			<p>Facebook, which in 2010 had more than 750 million active users globally including over
			23 million in India, announced that its Hyderabad center would house online advertising and 
			developer support teams and provide round-the-clock, multilingual support to the social networking 
			site's users and advertisers globally. With this, Facebook joins other giants like Google, Microsoft, 
			Oracle, Dell, IBM and Computer Associates that have already set up shop. In Hyderabad, it is 
			registered as 'Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd'. </p>
			
			<p>Though Facebook did not specify its India investment or hiring figures, it said recruitment had
			already begun for a director of operations and other key positions at Hyderabad, which would 
			supplement its operations in California, Dublin in Ireland as well as at Austin, Texas. A 
			custom-built data center with substantially reduced &lpar;38&percnt; less&rpar;) power consumption compared to 
			existing Facebook data centers opened in April 2011 in Prineville, Oregon. In April 2012, 
			Facebook opened a second data center in Forest City, North Carolina, US. In June 2013, Facebook
			opened a third data center in Luleå, Sweden. In November 2014, Facebook opened a fourth data center 
			in Altoona, Iowa, US. In September 2016, Facebook announced a coming datacenter in Los Lunas, New 
			Mexico in 2018 powered by renewable energy. </p>
			
			<p>On October 1, 2012, CEO Zuckerberg visited Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia 
			and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market. Russia's communications minister tweeted that 
			Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away 
			Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. Facebook has roughly 9 
			million users in Russia, while domestic analogue VK has around 34 million. </p>
			
			<p>The establishment of a woodworking facility on the Menlo Park campus was announced at the end of 
			August 2013. The facility, opened in June 2013, provides equipment, safety courses and a woodworking 
			learning course. Employees are required to purchase materials at the in-house store. A Facebook 
			spokesperson explained that the intention of setting up the facility is to encourage employees to 
			think in an innovative manner because of the different environment; it also serves as an attractive 
			perk for prospective employees. On November 21, 2016 Facebook announced that it will open its new London
			headquarters next year and create another 500 jobs in the UK. New headquarters will be in Fitzrovia in 
			central London at a site that is currently undergoing redevelopment. Facebook's London-based executive,
			Nicola Mendelsohn said &lpar;The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company&rpar;. In August 2017, 
			Facebook announced the opening of a new office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. Facebook will occupy
			the top three floors of 100 Binney St in Kendall Square and share the building with the pharmaceutical 
			employees from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The offices will be home to Facebook's &ldquo;Connectivity Lab&rdquo;, a group
			focused on bringing Internet access and technology to 4 billion people who do not have access to the Internet. </p>
