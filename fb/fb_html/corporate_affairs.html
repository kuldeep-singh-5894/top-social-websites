		<h1>Management</h1>
		
		<div class="center">
			<p>Facebook's key management personnel consists of <strong><a href="facebook_leadership.html">Mark Zuckerberg</a></strong> (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer),
			<strong><a href="facebook_leadership.html">Sheryl Sandberg</a></strong> (Chief Operating Officer), <strong><a href="facebook_leadership.html">David Wehner</a></strong>
			(Chief Financial Officer),<strong><a href="facebook_leadership.html">Mike Schroepfer</a></strong> (Chief Technology Officer), and 
			<strong><a href="facebook_leadership.html">Chris Cox</a></strong>(Chief Product Officer) As of June 30, 2017, Facebook has 20,658 employees. </p>

		<h1>Revenue</h1>
		<div class="center">
			<p>Facebook ranked No. 76 in the 2018 <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/">Fortune 500</a> list of the largest United States corporations by 
			total revenue. Most of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising. Facebook generally has a lower 
			clickthrough rate (CTR) for advertisements than most major websites. According to BusinessWeek.com, 
			banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared 
			to those on the Web as a whole, although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. 
			For example, while Google users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 
			8&percnt; of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches), Facebook's users click on advertisements 
			an average of 0.04&percnt; of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages). Successful advertising campaigns
			on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05&percnt; to 0.04&percnt;, and CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks. </p>
			
			<p>The cause of Facebook's low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling ad blocking software and their
			adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site's primary purpose being social communication rather 
			than content viewing. According to digital consultancy iStrategy Labs in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users 
			aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook's Social Advertising platform compared to 2011. However, <em>Time
			</em>writer and reporter Christopher Matthews stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results&colon; </p>
			
			<p>A big part of Facebook's pitch is that it has so much information about its users that it can more effectively 
			target ads to those who will be responsive to the content. If Facebook can prove that theory to be true, then it may
			not worry so much about losing its cool cachet. </p>
			
			<p>A portion of Facebook revenue comes from the "firehose" access, bulk access to the social media data sold to 
			the third parties. In December 2014, a report from Frank N. Magid and Associates found that the percentage of teens 
			aged 13 to 17 who used Facebook fell to 88&percnt; in 2014, down from 94&percnt; in 2013 and 95&percnt; in 2012. Zuckerberg, alongside 
			other Facebook executives, have questioned the data in such reports; although, a former Facebook senior employee has
			commented: &rdquo;Mark Zuckerberg is very willing to recognize the strengths in other products and the flaws in Facebook.&ldquo; </p>
			
			<p>On pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49&percnt; for Wall posts.
			A study found that, for video advertisements on Facebook, over 40&percnt; of users who viewed the videos viewed the entire video,
			while the industry average was 25&percnt; for in-banner video ads. </p>
			
			<p>The company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US&dollar;2.59 billion 
			were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US &dollar;7.87 billion 
			were made for the entirety of 2013&semi; and Facebook's annual profit for 2013 was US&dollar;1.5 billion. During the same time, 
			independent market research firm <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a> released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global 
			digital ad revenues in 2013 &lpar;Google's share was 32.4 per cent&rpar;. Revenue for the June 2014 quarter rose to &dollar;2.68 billion, 
			an increase of 67 per cent over the second quarter of 2013. Mobile advertising revenue accounted for around 62 per cent 
			of advertising revenue, an increase of approximately 41 per cent over the comparable quarter of the previous year. In
			December 2017, the company announced that it would no longer route all of its revenues through its Ireland headquarters, 
			but rather record revenue locally in each of the countries where it is generated. Later Facebook received a charge 
			of &dollar;1.63 billion by European Union for the data breach. </p>

		<h1> Number of advertisers </h1>
		<div class="center">
			<p>In February 2015, Facebook announced that it had reached two million active advertisers
			with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser is an advertiser that
			has advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days. In March 2016, Facebook announced 
			that it reached three million active advertisers with more than 70&percnt; from outside the US</p>
