		<p><img src="../images/t.7.jpg" class="float-img">Snapchat is one of the top social networks that digital marketers are paying attention to. Fleetingness and temporality of Snapchat are its most attractive features in digital marketing. The feature is in conformity with real-time marketing and Snapchat makes good use of the real-time attention to this feature. It can help companies grasp the hot spots in promoting publicity so that it attracts the attention of the users. Unlike other social networks, the subject of Snapchat is video-based. Therefore, comparing to text, an interesting and creative video can leave a vivid memory in the audience. At the same time, "Live Stories" allows users to upload videos on specific activities and events. On one hand, multi-angle videos show more perspectives and meet the needs of the users. On the other hand, it appeals to more people to use Snapchat and join the events. In term of the marketing process, Snapchat plays the role of attracting attention, inducing interest and stimulating purchase desire for the customers. In other words, Snapchat plays an important role in digital marketing in combination with the AIDA (marketing) model and modern digital technology. This comprised some examples:
			•	Sour Patch Kids Campaign: In the summer of 2014, Sour Patch Kids launched on Snapchat and partnered with Vine star Logan Paul. A few days later, more than 120,000 new users on Snapchat followed Sour Patch Kids, 2.3 million snap impressions shot by subscribers and 1,900 mentions of the Snapchat campaign on Twitter.
			•	GrubHub's Innovative Campaign: GrubHub hosted 'SnapHunt' in 2014, which was a week-long scavenger hunt.
