	<p>WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum is leaving the company amid arguments with parent company Facebook over 
	data privacy and the messaging app’s business model, according to a report from The Washington Post. Koum, together
	with his fellow co-founder Brian Acton, sold WhatsApp to Facebook in 2014 for an eye-popping sum of $19 billion, $3
	billion of which consisted of Facebook stock granted to both Koum and Acton, who left the company back in September. 
	Koum confirmed his departure in a personal Facebook post today. 
Koum’s Facebook post does not mention any inner turmoil at WhatsApp or address any of The Washington Post’s reporting,
 which suggests Koum took issue with Facebook’s approach to data privacy and encryption:
It’s been almost a decade since Brian and I started WhatsApp, and it’s been an amazing journey with some of the best people. 
But it is time for me to move on. I’ve been blessed to work with such an incredibly small team and see how a crazy amount of focus can
 produce an app used by so many people all over the world.
I’m leaving at a time when people are using WhatsApp in more ways than I could have imagined. The team is stronger than ever and it’ll continue
 to do amazing things. I’m taking some time off to do things I enjoy outside of technology, such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working
 on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee. And I’ll still be cheering WhatsApp on – just from the outside. Thanks to everyone who has made this journey possible.</p>
In response, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to Koum in a comment saying,<br> &ldquo;Jan:<font size="4" color="red"> <i>I will miss working so closely with you. I’m grateful for 
everything you’ve done to help connect the world, and for everything you’ve taught me, including about encryption and its ability to take power from
 centralized systems and put it back in people’s hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp</i>.&rdquo;<br>
